# SRB2Kart-CLI
Kurzov's SRB2Kart Command-Line Launcher: a command line interface for launching Sonic Robo Blast 2 Kart.

# Dependencies
The CLI depends on MD5DEEP, a checksum comparison tool. It can be obtained from the following website: http://md5deep.sourceforge.net/. Extract the file named MD5DEEP64.EXE to the location that the launcher file is at.

# Other Notes
As this program is far from finished, I do not have any EXEs to run. For now, you will need to install Python and then run the launch-srb2kart.py file... however I do have plans to provide working executables later on, just not at this point.
